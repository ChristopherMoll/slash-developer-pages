## To begin

* Have you [gathered a list of the public APIs](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/get-started-with-apis#audit) that your agency (and sub-agencies) currently publish?  
  * If your agency has not yet made an API, get started [by building your first](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/how-to-make-apis-overview).
  * Do each of your APIs have an html homepage that provides access to all relevant resources for the APIs?
* Have you [created a developer hub](http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government/get-started-with-apis#implement)?
  * Do the urls agency.gov/developer, agency.gov/developers, and agency.gov/api each direct visitors to this hub?
  * Does the hub provide a path to the homepages for each of your agency's APIs? 
  * Does the hub convey to visitors that they can reliably expect to find your agency's future APIs also linked from this hub? 
  * Does the hub offer a front-facing feedback mechanism?
  * Does the hub offer to your GitHub account?
  * Does the hub offer a link to your agency’s data hub, maps hub, or other relevant sections? 
  * Does the hub offer a link to other agency developer hubs? 
  * For departments, does the hub offer links to your agencys' developer hubs?  For sub-cabinet agencies, does the hub offer a link to your department's developer hub?  
  * Does the hub offer a link to all government GitHub accounts? 
  * Does the hub offer access to basic ‘What is an API?’ information?
  * Does your hub provide a means of sharing announcements with developers (e.g., new APIs, new resources, upcoming service interruptions, planned deprecation)?
* Does your agency have a public GitHub account?  
  * Has your agency made public a project in its GitHub account? 
  * Is your agency's GitHub account available to the different units of your agency? 
  * Is your agency's GitHub account registered with the [Social Media Registry](http://registry.usa.gov/accounts?service_id=github)?

## Next 


* For your agency's individual APIs:
  * Have you made available code samples?
  * Have you provided interactive documentation?
  * Have you made SDKs available?
  * If you employ API keys, have you made sure that the developer can receive a key on demand and without delay?  
* For your developer hub:
  * Have you created a unified Terms of Service for your APIs? 
  * Have you made an FAQ section available, including a means for the public to request new questions?
  * Have you created an Apps Gallery to showcase mashups and applications that utilize your APIs?
  * Have you created a status dashboard for your APIs?

* Have you created a public data hub? 
* Have you identified a data/API point person?
* Have you identified a data/API working group that covers the organization? 
* For sub-cabinet agencies, have you ensured that your APIs are being shared on your department's developer hub?
* Have you registered your API at PW, etc.  
* Have you reviewed your most important data/services and low hanging fruit for consideration for your next APIs?
* Have you reached out to projects currently in development in order to request that they integrate API production into their requirements.
 

## Advanced

* Have you developed a plan for systematically API-enabling your current systems and data?
* Have you assembled relevant stakeholders and begun the conversation about normalizing API documentation and design? 
* If you have multiple API key solutions, have you set about normalizing them? 
* Have you published a roadmap for your future API plans?  
* Have you instituted a means of version control for your APIs?
* Have you created a means for your developers to engage with each other?  
* Have you enabled an API for your website content?  
* Have you developed an API-first strategy for upcoming projects? 
* Have you set up a means of allowing relevant agency stakeholders to regularly consume the usage metrics of your APIs?  
* Have you disseminated to the different units of your agency an encouragement to produce their first API if they haven’t already. 
* Have you disseminated to the different units of your agency an encouragement to consume your agency's own APIs if they haven’t already. 
* Have you looked for opportunities to consume other agencies' APIs to avoid maintaining duplicative services?
